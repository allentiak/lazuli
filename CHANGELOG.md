## 0.1.12
- Fixed InkConsole not opening (https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-chlorine/issues/93)
- Better evaluate-block and evaluate-top-block without using Atom API (still behind the experimental features)

### Experimental features on this version
- Commands "evaluate-selection", "evaluate-top-block" and "evaluate-block" without using Atom's APIs. They also are aware of reader symbols, so now `evaluate-block` over `'(+ 1 2 3)` will return a list, not run the function.

- Fixed load-file on non-saved or non-editor tabs (https://github.com/mauricioszabo/atom-chlorine/issues/75)

### Experimental features on this version
- To be able to support multiple NS on the same files and also to remove internal Atom's
API on detecting the current start/end forms, there's a new way to detect start/end
of forms. This affects the commands "evaluate-selection" and "evaluate-top-block" (but
not "evaluate-block" because of other issues). These two new ways of evaluating are
**not stable yet** and they'll fail with `::server/port` kind of symbols, for example.
